# Lottery-Smart-Contract
developed a lottery system on solidity.
This smart contract will make entering and choosing a winner for the lottery more Trustable, and only the deployer will have the right to pick a winner, but not on his will. The random unit() function will pick up the anonymous winner.
One player can't register multiple times in a lottery.
After picking the winner, the lottery will go on default settings and start a new lottery.
